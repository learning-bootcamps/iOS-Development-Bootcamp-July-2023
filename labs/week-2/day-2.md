## Objective:

In this lab, students will explore various SwiftUI concepts, including views and modifiers, styles and animations, scrollviews, creating custom views, and reacting to device appearance theme changes. They will learn how to design dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces in their iOS apps.

## Instructions:

1. Create a new Swift playground or Xcode project to complete the lab tasks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each task below.
3. Write your code in a clear and organized manner, following best practices.

## Requirements:

1. Xcode (latest version)
2. Basic knowledge of Swift syntax and variables

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Understanding Views and Modifiers

- Create a SwiftUI View with multiple text and image views using the `Text` and `Image` views.
- Apply various modifiers such as font, color, padding, and alignment to customize the views.

### Task 2: Applying Styles and Animations

- Implement animation to create a fade-in effect for the views using the `.opacity` modifier.
- Apply custom styles to the buttons, texts, or images to enhance the user interface.

### Task 3: Working with ScrollViews

- Create a `ScrollView` to display a list of items or content that can be scrolled.
- Experiment with different scroll view styles and observe the scrolling behavior.

### Task 4: Creating Custom Views

- Design a custom SwiftUI View with a unique layout and functionality.
- Utilize combinations of existing SwiftUI views and modifiers to create the custom view.

### Task 5: Reacting to Device Appearance Theme

- Use the `.preferredColorScheme` modifier to adjust the app's appearance based on device theme.
- Implement dark mode support for the app to adapt to the user's preference.

## Submission Guidelines:
