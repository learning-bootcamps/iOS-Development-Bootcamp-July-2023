## Objective:

In this lab, students will learn how to build dynamic lists and implement forms with user input validation in SwiftUI. They will also explore customizing list elements for a more personalized user experience.

## Instructions:

1. Create a new Swift playground or Xcode project to complete the lab tasks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each task below.
3. Write your code in a clear and organized manner, following best practices.

## Requirements:

1. Xcode (latest version)
2. Basic knowledge of Swift syntax and variables

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Building Dynamic Lists

- Create a list of items using the SwiftUI `List` view and populate it with dummy data.
- Implement dynamic row creation to display different types of items in the list.

### Task 2: Navigation and Detail View

- Implement navigation from the list to a detail view using `NavigationLink`.
- Customize the detail view to display specific details based on the selected item.

### Task 3: Implementing Forms

### Task 6: Bonus Task - Enhancing User Experience

- Implement a search feature to filter items in the list dynamically.
- Add animations to enhance the user experience when navigating between views.

## Submission Guidelines:

- Create new repository name it as "iOS-Developemnt-Bootcamp-July-2023-Week-2-Day-4-Lab".
- Upload your project files to the repo you just created.
