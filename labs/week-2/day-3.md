## Objective:

In this lab, students will learn how to create navigation views and navigation bars in SwiftUI. They will practice passing data between different views and explore the usage of `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@ObservableObject` for managing state and updating views.

## Instructions:

1. Create a new Swift playground or Xcode project to complete the lab tasks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each task below.
3. Write your code in a clear and organized manner, following best practices.

## Requirements:

1. Xcode (latest version)
2. Basic knowledge of SwiftUI syntax and views

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Creating Navigation Views

- Design a SwiftUI View that serves as the main entry point of the app.
- Implement a navigation view with a navigation bar and a title for the main view.
- Add a button to navigate to a second view.

### Task 2: Passing Data Between Views

- Create a second SwiftUI View to display detailed information.
- Pass data from the main view to the second view when the button is tapped.
- Display the received data in the second view.

### Task 3: Using @State

- In the main view, use `@State` to manage a variable that changes the view's appearance.
- Implement a button in the main view to toggle the state variable and observe the UI update.

### Task 4: Using @Binding

- Create a custom SwiftUI View that contains a text field and a button.
- Use `@Binding` to allow the parent view to modify the text field value.
- Update the main view to include this custom view and showcase the two-way binding.

### Task 5: Using @ObservableObject

- Define an `ObservableObject` class with a published property to represent data.
- In the main view, create an instance of the `ObservableObject` class and observe the data change.
- Implement a button in the main view to update the data and see the UI reflect the changes.

## Submission Guidelines:

- Create new repository name it as "iOS-Developemnt-Bootcamp-July-2023-Week-2-Day-3-Lab".
- Upload your project files to the repo you just created.
- Submit your project repo link as comment to [here](https://github.com/learning-bootcamps/iOS-Development-Bootcamp-July-2023/issues/13).

## Grading Criteria:

Your lab assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Correctness and completion of tasks (50%)
- Code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices (30%)
- Proper implementation of SwiftUI navigation and data passing (20%)

## Additional Notes:

- You may ask the lab instructor for assistance during lab hours.
- Avoid plagiarism; write the code yourself.
- Late submissions will not be accepted without prior approval.

## Deadline:

Submit your completed lab assignment prior start of next session.
