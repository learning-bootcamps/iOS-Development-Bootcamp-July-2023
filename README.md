# Introduction

Welcome to the iOS App Development Bootcamp! In this course, we will guide you through the exciting journey of building iOS applications. We understand that many of you are non-native English speakers, so we'll use simple language to ensure everyone can follow along easily.

## Purpose

The purpose of this bootcamp is to equip you with the essential skills and knowledge to develop iOS apps confidently. By the end of the program, you'll be proficient in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Firebase integration, OpenSource APIs, and version control using Git and Github.

## Expectations

- Attend all sessions promptly.
- Be actively engaged and ask questions.
- Complete assignments and projects on time.
- Respect your fellow learners and instructors.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment.
- Refrain from discriminatory or offensive behavior.
- Do not plagiarize or claim others' work as your own.

## Journey

Throughout the bootcamp, you'll embark on a hands-on journey, creating various iOS projects, from simple to complex. Each project will build upon your skills, leading to a final customized iOS app that incorporates all the techniques and services you've learned.

# Overview

## Goals

By the end of this bootcamp, learners will achieve the following goals:

- Learn Swift Programming Language
- Attain proficiency in SwiftUI
- Gain familiarity with UIKit
- Understand how to integrate with Backend using Firebase
- Learn how to use OpenSource APIs
- Master version control with Git and Github

## **Outcomes**

By the end of the bootcamp, learners will have completed the following four projects:

1. **Project 1: Simple Task Manager (Week 2)** - Create a basic task manager app using SwiftUI. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, and the app should maintain a persistent data store.
2. **Project 2: Weather App (Week 4)** - Develop a weather app that fetches data from a public API and displays weather conditions for a given location. Users can view current weather and a 5-day forecast, and the app should use a OpenWeatherAPI
3. **Project 3: Social Media Feed (Week 6)** - Build a social media feed app that fetches and displays posts from various users. Users can like, comment, and share posts, and the app should have a seamless user experience, and the app should use Firestore.
4. **Project 4: Custom iOS App (Week 8)** - Learners will conceptualize and build a unique iOS app of their choice. They will have the creative freedom to demonstrate their skills and showcase their ability to develop a complete app from scratch.
